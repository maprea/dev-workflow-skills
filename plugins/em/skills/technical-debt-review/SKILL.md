# Technical Debt Review

Produce a strategic picture of where the codebase is accumulating debt and what to do about it. The goal is a prioritized roadmap, not an exhaustive list of every imperfection.

## Step 1: Identify Hotspots

Don't try to review everything. Focus on where pain is concentrated.

**Code complexity signals:**
- Files or functions with high cyclomatic complexity (many branches, deep nesting)
- Functions over ~50 lines — usually doing too much (SRP violation)
- Classes over ~300 lines — usually a God class or multiple responsibilities
- High number of parameters (> 5 usually indicates missing abstraction)

**Change frequency signals (most valuable):**
- Files changed in almost every PR — high churn indicates poor separation of concerns or missing abstractions
- Files that always require changes together — tight coupling that should be decoupled
- Files with frequent bug fixes — instability indicates unclear ownership or poor test coverage

**Structural signals:**
- Circular dependencies between modules
- Modules that import from many other modules — likely a coordination layer doing too much
- Dead code (functions/classes with no callers)

**Test coverage signals:**
- Untested code paths in critical or high-churn files
- Tests that only test happy paths (no edge cases, no error cases)
- Test files significantly longer than the code they test (over-specified tests that break on refactoring)

Ask the user: Where do engineers slow down? What parts of the codebase do people avoid touching? Where do bugs keep appearing?

## Step 2: Categorize by Debt Type and Severity

For each hotspot, classify the debt:

**Debt types:**
| Type | Description | Typical fix |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Complexity debt** | Functions/classes doing too much | Extract, decompose, simplify |
| **Duplication debt** | Same logic in multiple places | Extract shared abstraction |
| **Test debt** | Missing or low-quality tests | Add tests before refactoring anything else |
| **Documentation debt** | Undocumented non-obvious behavior | Add comments, docstrings, decision records |
| **Architecture debt** | Wrong abstraction at system level | Restructure, introduce proper boundaries |
| **Dependency debt** | Outdated, vulnerable, or abandoned libraries | Upgrade or replace |
| **Observability debt** | No logging, metrics, or traceability | Add instrumentation |

**Severity:**
- **Critical**: Causing active bugs or security risks. Address immediately.
- **High**: Slowing down every sprint. Blocking new features. Schedule for next quarter.
- **Medium**: Painful but workable. Schedule when capacity allows.
- **Low**: Noticeable but not impeding. Do it opportunistically when touching related code.

## Step 3: Estimate Effort and Risk

For each hotspot, estimate:

**Effort**: hours/days/weeks of engineering work to address
**Risk**: probability that addressing this introduces new bugs (higher for untested, complex code)
**Prerequisite**: does this require tests before it can be safely changed? (almost always yes for High/Critical)

High-risk + no tests = address the tests first, before the underlying debt.

## Step 4: Prioritize by Value-to-Cost Ratio

Score each item: `(Severity × Impact on team velocity) / (Effort × Risk)`

Prioritize in this order:
1. **Quick wins**: Low effort, meaningful impact (inconsistent naming conventions, easy extractions)
2. **High pain, medium effort**: The things that slow every sprint down — worth dedicated sprint time
3. **Strategic investments**: High effort but unlocks future capability — needs executive buy-in and planned downtime from feature work
4. **Low impact**: Log them, don't schedule them — address opportunistically

Avoid the "big rewrite" trap. Long rewrites stall feature work, introduce new bugs, and often fail to ship. Prefer incremental improvement over big-bang rewrites.

## Step 5: Produce the Remediation Roadmap

Output a prioritized action plan:

**Immediate (this sprint):**
- [Quick win 1]: estimated [X hours], owner [Name]
- [Critical fix 1]: estimated [Y days], owner [Name]

**Next quarter:**
- [High-priority debt 1]: estimated [X weeks], requires [tests/migration/team availability]
- [High-priority debt 2]: ...

**Backlog (do when touching related code):**
- [Medium items to address opportunistically]

**Accepted debt (won't address):**
- [Items acknowledged but explicitly not worth fixing] — revisit if severity changes

## Principles Applied

- **KISS**: Simplify complexity first — complex code is the root cause of most other debt
- **DRY**: Eliminate duplication — find the patterns, create the abstraction
- **SRP**: Split God classes and functions doing multiple jobs into focused units
- **Tests before refactoring**: Never refactor untested code without adding tests first — you won't know if the refactor is correct

## Cross-Skill References

- `refactoring` — use for the actual small-scale, test-protected code improvements identified in this review
- `architecture-design` — use when debt is architectural (wrong boundaries, wrong abstractions at system level)
- `performance-optimization` — use when debt is causing measurable performance problems, not just code cleanliness
