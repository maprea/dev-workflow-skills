# TDD Workflow

Guide implementation through the red-green-refactor cycle. TDD produces code that is testable by design, has a living specification, and tends toward simpler solutions because you only write what's needed to pass the next test.

## ⛔ The Iron Law

**No production code without a failing test you have watched fail.**

If you wrote code before the test, delete it and restart from the test — don't keep it "as reference" or "adapt it" while writing the test. A test you didn't watch fail proves nothing: you don't know whether it tests the right thing. This is the one rule that the rest of the workflow protects.

## The Cycle

```

│           RED                     │

│  describes the next behavior      │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│           GREEN                   │

```

## Workflow

### Step 0: Plan the Test List

Before writing any test, create a list of behaviors to test. Derive this from acceptance criteria or the task description. Order from simplest to most complex:

1. **Happy path** — the simplest valid scenario
2. **Edge cases** — boundary values, empty inputs, single items
3. **Error cases** — invalid input, missing resources, permission failures
4. **Integration points** — interactions with other components

Present the test list to the user. This is the roadmap — each item becomes one red-green-refactor cycle.

### Step 1: RED — Write a Failing Test

Write exactly one test that describes the next behavior. The test should:

- Have a descriptive name that reads like a specification: `test_user_cannot_login_with_expired_password`
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern (or Given-When-Then)
- Test behavior, not implementation (assert on outputs, not internal state)
- Fail for the right reason (missing function, wrong return value — not syntax error)

Run the test and confirm it fails. Show the failure output to the user. If the test passes immediately, either the behavior already exists or the test is wrong.

### Step 2: GREEN — Make It Pass

Write the **minimum code** to make the failing test pass. This is critical — resist the urge to write the "right" solution. Minimum means:

- Hard-code a return value if that's enough
- Use the simplest possible data structure
- Skip error handling if no test requires it yet
- Ignore performance, elegance, or future needs

Run all tests (not just the new one). Everything must be green.

### Step 3: REFACTOR — Improve Under Green

Now improve the code while all tests stay green. Look for:

- **Duplication** → Extract methods, constants, or shared setup
- **Naming** → Rename to reveal intent
- **Complexity** → Simplify conditionals, flatten nesting
- **Responsibility** → Extract classes/modules if a function does too much

Also refactor the tests:
- Remove duplication in test setup (use fixtures/helpers)
- Improve test names if the behavior is clearer now
- Ensure tests are independent (no shared mutable state)

Run all tests after each refactoring step. If anything breaks, undo the last change immediately.

### Step 4: Repeat

Pick the next item from the test list. Return to Step 1.

After completing all items, do a final review — see [references/test-quality.md](references/test-quality.md).

## Adapting TDD to Different Contexts

**Unit tests** (default): Test a single function or class in isolation. Mock external dependencies. Fast feedback loop (milliseconds).

**Integration tests**: Test how components work together. Use for database queries, API endpoints, message handling. Slower but catch wiring bugs.

**Outside-in TDD**: Start with an acceptance test (failing), then drive the implementation with unit tests. Useful when you know the desired API or user interaction.

**Inside-out TDD**: Start with the core domain logic, build outward. Useful when the domain is complex and the interface is flexible.

Suggest the appropriate approach based on the task. Default to unit tests unless the task is primarily about integration.

## What NOT to TDD

TDD is a design tool, not a coverage tool. Don't TDD:
- Trivial getters/setters
- Framework configuration
- Third-party libraries themselves — test *your code's use* of them at the integration level; don't re-assert what the library's own tests already cover (its compression, its persistence, its parsing)
- UI layout (visual regression tools are better here)

## Principles Applied

- **YAGNI**: The test list prevents building more than needed. If there's no test for it, don't build it.
- **KISS**: Minimum code to pass forces simplicity.
- **Functional Independence**: Tests that mock dependencies encourage decoupled design.
- **DRY**: Refactoring phase explicitly targets duplication.
- **FIRST**: Tests should be Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, and Timely — see [references/test-quality.md](references/test-quality.md) for the full checklist and test smell detection.

## Rationalizations to reject

These are the excuses that lead to skipping the test. None of them hold up.

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "It's too simple to test" | Simple code still breaks. The test costs 30 seconds; the regression costs an afternoon. |
| "I'll add the tests after" | Tests written after the code pass immediately — they prove the code does what it does, not what it should. |
| "I already tested it manually" | Manual checks aren't repeatable and don't guard against the next regression. |
| "Deleting working code is wasteful" | Sunk cost. Unverified code is debt, not progress. |
| "Tests-after achieve the same thing" | Tests-first ask "what should this do?"; tests-after ask "what does this do?" — different specs. |
| "TDD will slow me down" | Debugging untested code is slower than writing the test first. |

## Red flags — stop and correct course

- You're writing implementation and will "get to the test next."
- A new test passes the first time you run it (you never saw RED).
- You can't explain why the test failed in the RED phase.
- You're glancing at not-yet-deleted draft code while writing the "test-first" version.

- `test-suite-design` — adding tests to existing code (this skill is for new code, test-first)
- `bug-investigating` — write a regression test for a found bug using this cycle
- `verification-before-completion` — the GREEN step is this gate: watch the test pass for real
