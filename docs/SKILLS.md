# Skill Catalog

All 44 skills in the library — 42 SDLC workflows plus two meta skills
(`skill-router`, the orchestrator, and `writing-skills`, the authoring guide).
Every skill's full description lives in `catalog.json` (what the orchestrator
routes on); this page is the human-readable index.

See [ROLES.md](ROLES.md) for which skills each role promotes, and the
[README](../README.md) for installation.

## Meta (2)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `skill-router` | Entry point and dispatcher — maps an intent to the right skill(s) and lays out the Golden Path workflow chains. Invoke it FIRST on any non-trivial task. Pairs with the optional [SessionStart hook](../hooks/README.md). |
| `writing-skills` | How to author, edit, and pressure-test skills — description/budget rules, progressive disclosure, the 3-eval rule, TDD-for-docs. The installable companion to [AUTHORING.md](AUTHORING.md). |
