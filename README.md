# Dev Workflow Skills for Claude Code

A curated collection of 40 SDLC Claude Code Agent Skills (plus two meta skills — `skill-router` and `writing-skills`) designed for senior software engineers who want to enforce best practices, maintain high code quality, and accelerate their development workflow.

## Philosophy

These skills encode the methodology of a disciplined engineer: DRY, YAGNI, KISS, functional independence, TDD, clean architecture, and thoughtful design decisions. Each skill guides Claude Code through a specific phase of the SDLC, ensuring consistent quality without sacrificing speed.

## Skills Overview

## Installation

### Per-project (recommended for teams)
```bash
cp -r skills/* your-project/.claude/skills/
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "feat: add dev workflow skills for Claude Code"
```

### Global (personal use across all projects)
```bash
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Using the installer

`install.sh` installs the frequent-skills subset (including `skill-router`) by default:

```bash
./install.sh                 # frequent skills -> ./.claude/skills/
./install.sh --all --global  # all skills -> ~/.claude/skills/
./install.sh --hook          # also set up the opt-in SessionStart hook (see hooks/README.md)
```

### Activation (optional hook)

Skills trigger from their descriptions, but under-triggering is the most common
failure mode at scale. The `skill-router` skill is the entry point; the optional
[SessionStart hook](hooks/README.md) injects a short pointer at session start so
Claude consults the router before substantial SDLC work. It's a nudge, not a
gate — the user's instructions always take precedence.

## Skill Architecture

Each skill follows the progressive disclosure pattern:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Entry point: metadata + core workflow (< 500 lines)
├── references/            # Deep-dive docs loaded on demand
│   └── principles.md     # Domain-specific guidelines
├── templates/             # Output templates
│   └── template.md       # Structured output formats
└── scripts/               # Utility scripts (optional)
    └── validate.sh        # Validation helpers
```

## Design Principles

1. **Concise over verbose** — Claude is smart; only add what it doesn't already know
2. **Progressive disclosure** — SKILL.md is the map; reference files are the territory
3. **Appropriate freedom** — Strict where fragile, flexible where creative
4. **Feedback loops** — Validate-fix-repeat for quality-critical operations
5. **Composable** — Skills can be used independently or combined in workflows

## Evaluation Strategy

Each skill includes an `evals/` directory with test scenarios. Safety-critical
and discipline skills also carry an optional `pressure_tests` block that tempts
the agent to skip the skill's Iron Law under named pressure levers:

```json
{
  "skill_name": "skill-name",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "Realistic user prompt",
      "expected_output": "Description of what good looks like",
      "assertions": ["Specific verifiable criteria"]
    }
  ],
  "pressure_tests": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "A request that tempts the agent to skip the discipline",
      "pressure": ["time", "sunk_cost", "authority", "exhaustion"],
      "expected_behavior": "How the skill should hold under that pressure",
      "assertions": ["Does NOT capitulate to ...", "Insists on ..."]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Running evals (TDD for the skill set)

Two runners replay these through the Claude API — generate a candidate reply
(skill loaded = GREEN, absent = RED), then judge each assertion with a skeptical
LLM-as-judge. See [EVALS.md](EVALS.md) for the full guide.

| Runner | Use | Needs |
|--------|-----|-------|
| `evals/workflow-runner.mjs` | Fast local RED/GREEN loop | Claude Code Workflow tool |
| `evals/run.py` | CI regression gate | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `pip install -r evals/requirements.txt` |

```bash
python evals/run.py --all --update-baseline      # record the golden baseline
python evals/run.py --changed --base origin/main # CI: only changed skills
```

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/skill-evals.yml`) runs on PRs touching
`skills/` and **gates on regression-vs-baseline** — a previously-green assertion
that now fails fails the build. It does not gate on an absolute pass rate (the
judge is intentionally harsh and some assertions span a whole session, not one
reply); the stable signals are *GREEN ≥ RED* and *no drift*.

## Building Skills

This section covers what you need to know to author a new skill or modify an existing one. It's also packaged as the installable `writing-skills` skill, which adds the SDO description rule and pressure-testing (TDD-for-docs) on top of these rules.

### Description Is Everything

The `description` field in SKILL.md's YAML frontmatter is the primary mechanism Claude uses to decide whether to load a skill. If the description doesn't match the user's prompt, the skill never runs — no matter how good the workflow is.

**Rules for writing descriptions:**
- **Keyword-rich**: Include all the phrases a user might say ("plan this feature", "scope this out", "break this down", "sprint planning"). Cast a wide net.
- **Third-person, present tense**: "Use when the user needs to..." not "I help with..."
- **~350 characters, hard cap 1024**: The 1024-char per-skill limit is enforced, but it is not the binding constraint at scale. Claude Code only injects skill listings up to `skillListingBudgetFraction` of the context (default 1% ≈ 2k tokens). With 30+ skills installed, ~350 chars per description is a realistic target — anything longer and `/doctor` will report descriptions being dropped.
- **Slightly assertive**: "Use when the user reports a bug" triggers more reliably than "May be used for bug reports." Lean toward the pushy side — under-triggering is the most common failure mode.
- **Include related vocabulary**: If your skill is about deployments, also mention "go live", "ship it", "push to production", "release".

**Recommended pattern:** `<one-line purpose>. Triggers: <comma-separated keywords>. <one-line boundary or delegation note>.`

**Skill Discovery Optimization (SDO):** describe *when to use* the skill, not
*what it does internally*. Agents follow the description over the body, so a
description that summarizes the workflow ("reviews code in two passes") triggers
worse than one that lists situations. The `Triggers:` keyword list above is the
when-to-use expressed as the phrases a user actually types — that's what makes
this format SDO-compliant.

### Listing Budget

Every installed skill contributes its `name` + `description` to a single listing that Claude Code injects on every prompt. The total is capped by `skillListingBudgetFraction` in `settings.json` (default `0.01`, i.e. 1% of context). When the cap is exceeded, the least-recently-used descriptions are dropped, and dropped skills will not trigger.

Check with `/doctor` — it reports dropped descriptions when this happens.

If you install many skills, raise the budget in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "skillListingBudgetFraction": 0.02 }
```

At 2% (~4k tokens of context budget), the full skill set in this repo fits comfortably.

### Frontmatter Fields

Beyond `name` and `description`, two optional fields are recommended:

| Field | Purpose | Used in this repo |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | Pin a default model when the skill activates | `haiku` for cheap formatting/lookup skills, `sonnet` for most design/review work, `opus` for deep multi-step reasoning (architecture, security audit, debt review, RCA) |
| `allowed-tools` | Restrict tools the skill can call | Most skills use `Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Edit`. Implementation- or infra-adjacent skills add `Bash`. Research-oriented skills (dependency-management, security-audit) add `WebFetch, WebSearch`. |

Neither field counts toward the listing budget — only `name` + `description` do.

### Token Economy and Progressive Disclosure

Every token in SKILL.md costs token budget when the skill is loaded. Reference files cost zero tokens until Claude explicitly loads them. This creates three loading tiers:

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens): Skill name + description. Always loaded when the skill is matched.
2. **SKILL.md** (< 500 lines): Core workflow, principles, and cross-references. Loaded when skill activates.
3. **references/ and templates/**: Deep-dive docs, loaded on demand within a conversation.

This means a skill with 10,000 lines of reference material costs zero extra tokens until Claude needs that material. **Put everything Claude already knows in references; put only what's unique to your workflow in SKILL.md.**

### When to Use Scripts, References, and Templates

| Resource type | Use when | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `references/*.md` | Deep technical detail that's only needed sometimes (patterns, checklists, domain knowledge) | `owasp-top-10.md`, `debugging-patterns.md` |
| `templates/*.md` | Output format matters for consistency (documents, specs, reports) | `adr.md`, `pull-request.md` |
| `scripts/` | A step should always happen identically — pixel-perfect output, file generation, validation | A script that generates a migration file in the project's exact format |

These workflow skills guide *thinking*, not deterministic file operations. When in doubt, use a reference file over a script.

### Eval Design

Each skill must have exactly 3 evals:

1. **Happy path**: The canonical use case. User provides good input, skill produces the expected artifact.
2. **Edge case**: Unusual but valid input that tests a corner of the workflow (empty state, very large scope, ambiguous requirements).
3. **Scope boundary**: A prompt that seems related but should NOT trigger this skill, or that triggers it and correctly hands off to a different skill.

The `assertions` array should contain specific, verifiable criteria — not vague goals like "produces a good plan."

For safety-critical and discipline skills, add a **`pressure_tests`** block on
top of the three evals: a scenario that tempts the agent to skip the skill's
Iron Law under combined pressure (time, sunk cost, authority, exhaustion), with
assertions that it doesn't capitulate. Bulletproof skills by capturing the exact
rationalizations a fresh agent uses *without* the skill (RED), then writing the
minimum that counters them (GREEN) — see [EVALS.md](EVALS.md) and the
`writing-skills` skill.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Over-stuffing SKILL.md**: If your skill is over 300 lines, move domain knowledge to `references/`. Claude doesn't need to be taught what a REST API is.
2. **Vague descriptions**: "Helps with development tasks" will never trigger. Be specific about the scenario.
3. **Time-sensitive content**: Don't include specific version numbers, dates, or tool versions in SKILL.md. They go stale. Put them in references/ with a note to check the latest docs.
4. **Windows-style paths**: Use forward slashes in all paths — users may be on any OS.
5. **Imperative commands in ALL CAPS**: "ALWAYS use parameterized queries." Modern LLMs respond better to reasoning: "Use parameterized queries — string interpolation enables SQL injection."
6. **Missing feedback loops**: If a step produces output that could be wrong, add a verification step. "Run the tests. If they fail, fix the issue before proceeding."
7. **Not testing the skill**: Write the evals before publishing. A skill that looks good but doesn't trigger is useless.

### Model Variance

Skills are tested against Claude Sonnet as the baseline. What works on Sonnet will typically work on Opus; Haiku may need more explicit guidance in SKILL.md. If you plan cross-model deployment, test on the lowest capability model you'll target and add detail accordingly.

### Explain the Why

Skills that explain *why* a practice matters produce better outcomes than skills that issue commands. Compare:

- **Command**: "Always write a regression test before fixing a bug."
- **Why**: "Write a regression test before fixing the bug — without it, the same bug will silently reappear in a future refactor."

The second version helps Claude make good judgment calls in edge cases. Apply this throughout your workflow steps.
