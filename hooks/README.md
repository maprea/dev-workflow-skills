# SessionStart hook — the activation baseline writer

This hook drives the **name-only baseline** (see [ROLES.md](../ROLES.md)). On every
session boundary (`startup|resume|clear|compact`) it writes the activation
`skillOverrides` into `settings.local.json` — all skills `name-only` except the
pinned set (and the active role's set, if one is set) — and emits
`reloadSkills: true` so it applies to the current session. It also injects a short
pointer telling Claude to route through `skill-router`.

It runs on every boundary because the skill listing is **not re-injected after
`/compact`**, so the baseline must be re-asserted.

The hook is opt-in, but **the dynamic activation model depends on it**: without
it, no baseline is written and you fall back to plain (overflow-prone)
description-triggering. It must be installed by `./install.sh --hook` (or with the
machinery present) because it calls `resolve.py` and reads the `.roles.json`
marker next to the skills.

## What's here

- `session-start.sh` — writes the baseline + emits the SessionStart JSON.
- `hooks.json` — a reference snippet to merge into your Claude Code settings.

## Enable it

The easiest path:

```bash
./install.sh --hook          # project-local (.claude/)
./install.sh --hook --global # global (~/.claude/)
```

`--hook` copies `session-start.sh` (and `resolve.py`) into your config's `hooks/`
and prints the exact `settings.json` snippet to paste, with the absolute
`HOOK_PATH` filled in. It does **not** modify your `settings.json` automatically —
merging is left to you so your existing config is never clobbered. (The hook then
manages the `skillOverrides` key in `settings.local.json` at runtime.)

## Manual setup

1. Copy `session-start.sh` somewhere stable and make it executable
   (`chmod +x session-start.sh`).
2. Add the `hooks` block from `hooks.json` to `.claude/settings.json` (project)
   or `~/.claude/settings.json` (global), replacing `HOOK_PATH` with the
   absolute path to your copy of `session-start.sh`.
3. Start a new session. Run `/doctor` to confirm the hook is registered.

## Disable it

Remove the `SessionStart` block from your `settings.json`. That's it.

## Requirements

`session-start.sh` uses `python3` to compute/merge the baseline and to encode its
JSON. If `python3` is unavailable it still emits the nudge (via a `sed` fallback)
but skips writing the baseline — so the dynamic model effectively needs `python3`.
