# Skill Router

This project installs the **swe-workflow skills library** — a set of structured
SDLC workflows. This skill is the **orchestrator**: most skills are loaded
**name-only** (listed but not auto-triggering), so they activate by being
invoked. Use this router to pick the right skill — or skills — quickly and invoke them,
then hand off and get out of the way. A task that spans several domains or phases
needs several skills; invoke all that apply, not just the first.

## Activation model (why this skill matters)

To keep the context listing small, only a pinned set auto-triggers (this router
plus the safety skills: `verification-before-completion`, `tdd-workflow`,
`bug-investigating`, `incident-response`, `code-reviewing`). Every other skill is
**name-only** — invocable, but it will not fire on its own. Routing through this
orchestrator is how those skills get activated. A **role** can promote a working
set back to auto-triggering; switch roles with the `/role <name>` command
(`/role` to see options, `/role all` to reset to baseline).

## The rule

Before substantial software work — planning a feature, making a structural or
data decision, implementing, debugging, reviewing, refactoring, or shipping —
**check whether a dedicated skill applies, and invoke it.** This is the default,
not an optional extra. The skills encode the *how* and *why* of doing each
activity well, so you don't have to re-derive them.

Routing is **not a once-per-session gate.** Re-route whenever the *kind* of work
changes — analysis → implementation → writing tests → review → shipping — because
each phase's skill is loaded only when invoked, and the one you need for the new
phase almost certainly isn't loaded yet. A session that routed for analysis and
then writes tests an hour later without re-routing silently drops the testing
skills' guidance.

Do **not** talk yourself out of it because the task "looks like a one-liner,"
touches only one file, or seems obvious. Small structural changes (renames,
config edits, dependency bumps) and anything that matches a specific skill's
domain (accessibility, API design, security, data modeling, migrations,
performance…) are exactly what the skills are for. When in doubt, route.

Skip **only** for genuinely trivial, conversational, or information-lookup
requests where no workflow adds value, or when the user tells you not to use a
skill or to "just do X". **The user's explicit instructions always take
precedence** over any skill.

## How to route

1. **Get the full catalog.** Read `.catalog.json` from the installed skills
   directory (the parent of this skill — e.g. `.claude/skills/.catalog.json` or
   `~/.claude/skills/.catalog.json`). It holds every skill's full description, so
   you can match precisely even though their descriptions aren't in the listing.
   If it's absent (e.g. a plugin install), use the phase index below.
2. **Match** the user's intent to **every** skill that applies — not just the
   single best fit. A request often spans more than one domain (e.g. "review for
   accessibility *and* UX" → both `accessibility-design` and `ui-ux-design`) or
   more than one phase (a feature → planning, then data model, then API, …).
3. **Invoke them by name** via the Skill tool — name-only skills are fully
   invocable; the listing just doesn't show their description. When several skills
   apply, **invoke them all, in workflow order, and integrate each one's guidance
   — do not stop after the first.** Stating "I'll use both" is not enough; you
   must actually call each one (invoke the next applicable skill before you finish
   — e.g. load the UX skill before writing a combined a11y+UX review, and on a
   Golden Path chain invoke each phase's skill as you reach it). "Hand off" means
   stop narrating the routing and start the work, NOT "one skill is enough." Route
   to a single skill only when the task genuinely maps to exactly one.
4. If a matched skill isn't installed (a subset/plugin install), read its
   `SKILL.md` inline if present, or tell the user which skill/role to add.
5. If the work spans several phases, follow the relevant **Golden Path** chain,
   invoking each skill in the chain as you reach its phase.
6. If nothing fits, proceed normally — not everything needs a skill.

## Role-scoped routing (optional)

If a role is active (a `.active-role` marker sits beside the skills, or the
SessionStart hook named one), lead with that role's working set — read
`.roles.json` for it — then fall back to the rest of the catalog. The user can
change the promoted set with `/role <name>`. Either way you can invoke any
installed skill by name, regardless of role.

- **ml-model-deployment** — serving, monitoring, drift detection, safe rollouts

## Golden Path workflow chains

When work spans phases, chain skills rather than improvising:

**New feature**
`feature-planning` → `architecture-design` (if structural) → `data-modeling`
(if schema) → `tdd-workflow` → `code-reviewing` → `deployment-checklist`

**Bug / incident**
`incident-response` (if prod is down) → `bug-investigating` → `tdd-workflow`
(regression test) → `deployment-checklist`

**Continuous improvement**
`technical-debt-review` → `refactoring` → `dependency-impact-analysis`
(blast radius) → `test-suite-design` (if coverage is thin)

**Pre-public / pre-milestone review**
`strategic-review` (vision, positioning, market) → `project-review` (scope,
roadmap, implementation, evidence) → synthesis → `artifact-design` (interactive
report). See `strategic-review/templates/full-review-prompt.md` for the combined brief.

## When NOT to route

- Pure questions, explanations, or conversation with no workflow component.
- The user named a specific skill or explicitly opted out — follow them.
- Tiny mechanical edits (typo, rename) where a workflow is overhead.
