# Deployment Checklist

Ensure code is production-ready before deploying. This skill runs through a structured verification process that catches common deployment failures before they reach users.

## ⛔ The Iron Law

**Don't check a box you haven't verified.**

Every checked item is backed by evidence — a command you ran in this session or code you read — not memory or assumption. "Should be fine" is not a verification. A blocked deploy is far cheaper than a production incident, so when a gate fails, stop and fix it before proceeding.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess the Change

Understand the scope and risk of what's being deployed:

- **What changed?** Review the diff against the deployment target branch
- **Change type?** Feature / bugfix / hotfix / infrastructure / dependency update
- **Risk level?** Low (cosmetic), Medium (logic change), High (data migration, auth, payments)
- **Rollback plan?** Can this be reverted with a simple deploy, or does it require data migration reversal?

### Step 2: Run the Checklist

Walk through each section. Check items by reading code, running commands, and verifying artifacts.

#### Code Quality
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`, `pytest`, or project-specific command)
- [ ] No linting errors or warnings
- [ ] No `TODO` or `FIXME` items related to this change left unaddressed
- [ ] No debugging code (console.log, debugger, print statements) left in
- [ ] No commented-out code blocks

#### Testing
- [ ] New behavior has corresponding tests
- [ ] Edge cases and error paths are tested
- [ ] Integration tests pass against a clean environment
- [ ] If applicable: manual testing completed on staging

#### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- [ ] No new endpoints without authentication/authorization
- [ ] User input is validated and sanitized
- [ ] Dependencies have no known critical vulnerabilities (`npm audit`, `pip audit`)

#### Database & Data
- [ ] Migrations are forwards-compatible (old code works with new schema)
- [ ] Migrations are reversible
- [ ] Large data changes have been tested on production-sized data
- [ ] No destructive operations without confirmation (DROP, DELETE without WHERE)
- [ ] Backfill scripts are idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

#### Configuration & Environment
- [ ] New environment variables are documented and set in all target environments
- [ ] Feature flags are in the correct state for this release
- [ ] No environment-specific hardcoding (localhost URLs, test credentials)

#### Observability
- [ ] Errors are logged with sufficient context for debugging
- [ ] New endpoints/operations have appropriate metrics or monitoring
- [ ] Alert thresholds are reviewed for new functionality

#### Documentation
- [ ] README updated if setup steps changed
- [ ] API documentation updated for new/changed endpoints
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated (if project uses one)
- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly communicated

### Step 3: Report

Summarize the checklist results:

- **Ready to deploy**: All checks pass
- **Needs attention**: List specific items that need fixing
- **Blocked**: Critical issues that must be resolved (data loss risk, security gap, failing tests)

### Step 4: Deploy Safely

Based on the change risk level:

- **Low risk**: Deploy directly, monitor for 15 minutes
- **Medium risk**: Deploy to staging first, verify, then production. Monitor for 1 hour
- **High risk**: Deploy behind a feature flag, canary to a small percentage, monitor, then roll out gradually

## Quick Reference

For urgent hotfixes where the full checklist feels heavy, run at minimum:
1. Tests pass
2. No secrets in code
3. Migrations are reversible
4. Rollback plan exists

Everything else can be addressed in a follow-up, but these four prevent the worst outcomes.

## Principles Applied

- **KISS**: The simplest deploy that can safely reach production. Avoid adding complexity (new flags, new services) in the same deployment as the feature.
- **Defense in depth**: Validate at every gate — tests, staging, canary — not just once. Each gate catches a different class of failure.
- **Fail fast**: If a check fails, stop and fix before proceeding. A blocked deploy is far cheaper than a production incident.
- **YAGNI**: Don't deploy speculative configuration or unused feature flags. Unused config is future confusion.

See [references/pre-deploy-gates.md](references/pre-deploy-gates.md) for environment-specific checklists, schema migration safety, and rollback trigger criteria.

## Rationalizations to reject

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Tests passed in CI yesterday" | Verify against the exact commit being deployed, now — not a stale run. |
| "It's a tiny change, skip the checklist" | Tiny changes cause outages too. Run at least the four-item minimum. |
| "Migrations are probably reversible" | "Probably" is not verified. Confirm the down-path exists and runs. |
| "We'll add monitoring after launch" | You can't observe an incident you never instrumented. |
| "No time for staging" | Skipping staging on a high-risk change is how data-loss incidents start. |

## Red flags — stop and correct course

- Marking items complete from memory rather than checking.
- "Should be fine" / "probably works" language about any gate.
- Deploying a High-risk change with no rollback plan.
- Bundling a risky migration and a feature in the same deploy.

## Cross-Skill References

- `rollback-strategy` — design the rollback plan before deploying (required for High-risk changes)
- `configuration-strategy` — verify all environment variables and feature flags are configured correctly
- `incident-response` — use if the deployment causes a production incident
