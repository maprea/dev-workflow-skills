# Code Reviewing

Perform thorough, constructive code reviews that catch bugs, enforce principles, and improve code quality. Good reviews are specific, actionable, and educational — they explain *why*, not just *what*.

## Review Process

### Step 1: Understand the Context

Before reviewing line-by-line, understand the big picture:

- **What is this code supposed to do?** Read the PR description, linked issue, or ask the user.
- **What changed?** If reviewing a diff, understand the scope of changes.
- **What's the surrounding code like?** Read adjacent files for conventions and patterns.

### Step 2: First Pass — Structural Review

Look at the forest before the trees. Check:

- **Does the change belong here?** Is it in the right module/file?
- **Is the scope right?** Does it do one thing or is it mixing concerns?
- **Is the approach sound?** Before nitpicking syntax, is the overall strategy correct?
- **Are there missing pieces?** Tests? Documentation? Error handling? Migration?

### Step 3: Detailed Review

Review the code against these categories, in order of importance. See [references/review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md) for the detailed checklist.

**Severity levels for findings:**

- 🔴 **Blocker**: Must fix before merge (bugs, security issues, data loss risks)
- 🟡 **Suggestion**: Should fix, significantly improves quality (principle violations, missing tests)
- 🔵 **Nit**: Optional improvement (naming, style, minor simplification)

### Step 4: Present Findings

Structure your review as:

1. **Summary** (1-2 sentences: overall impression and most important finding)
2. **Blockers** (if any — these must be addressed)
3. **Suggestions** (improvements that meaningfully raise quality)
4. **Nits** (optional, non-blocking)
5. **Positive notes** (what's done well — this matters for morale and learning)

For each finding, provide:
- The specific location (file and line/function)
- What the issue is
- Why it matters (link to principle)
- A concrete suggestion for fixing it (show code when helpful)

### Step 5: Offer to Help Fix

After presenting findings, offer to help implement the suggested changes. Don't just criticize — help improve.

## Review Dimensions

These are the lenses through which code is examined:

**Correctness**: Does it work? Does it handle edge cases? Can it fail silently?

**Design Principles**: DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SRP, functional independence. See [references/review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md).

**Security**: Input validation, auth checks, SQL injection, XSS, secrets in code.

**Performance**: Obvious N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, missing indexes. Don't optimize prematurely, but flag clearly wasteful patterns.

**Testability**: Is the code testable? Are there tests? Do tests test behavior or implementation?

**Readability**: Can someone unfamiliar with this code understand it in one reading? Good naming, appropriate comments (why, not what), manageable function length.

**Error Handling**: Are errors caught, logged, and handled appropriately? Are error messages helpful? See [references/error-handling.md](references/error-handling.md) for detailed patterns (null safety, exception context, caller-oriented exceptions).

## Tone Guidelines

- Be specific: "This function does three things" beats "this could be cleaner"
- Be constructive: "Consider extracting X into its own function because..." beats "this is messy"
- Ask questions when uncertain: "Is this intentionally returning null here?" invites discussion
- Acknowledge good work: If something is well-written, say so
- Propose, don't command: "What do you think about..." respects the author's judgment
- Apply the Boy Scout Rule: note small cleanup opportunities near the changed code — a renamed variable, a dead import removed. These compound over time.

## Cross-Skill References

- `refactoring` — when the review surfaces code smells worth a structured cleanup
- `security-audit` — for a dedicated, deep security pass beyond the review checklist
- `verification-before-completion` — verify the change actually runs before approving, not from the diff alone
